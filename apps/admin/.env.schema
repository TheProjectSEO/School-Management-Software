# ⚠️ SCHEMA CONFIGURATION - READ THIS FIRST ⚠️
#
# The correct schema for this project is: "school software" (with a space)
#
# DO NOT use "n8n_content_creation" - that schema exists in the same database
# but contains DIFFERENT tables for article/content generation.
#
# To verify the correct schema, run:
#   npm run verify-schema
#
# This will check that "school software" has the correct tables:
# ✅ schools (with id, name, slug columns)
# ✅ sections (with school_id, name, grade_level, adviser_teacher_id)
# ✅ students (with school_id, profile_id, lrn, section_id)
# ✅ courses (with school_id, section_id, teacher_id)
# ✅ teacher_profiles (with profile_id, school_id, employee_id)
#
# If verification fails, DO NOT change the schema in lib/supabase/*.ts files!
# Instead, investigate why the tables are missing.

SUPABASE_SCHEMA="school software"
